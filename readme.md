# Print and Concatenate


- It turns out print has a super-power. We can give it as many different things to print as we want. All we need to do is put a comma , between every different thing in the ().

```py

myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

```
