# Print and Concatenate


- It turns out print has a super-power. We can give it as many different things to print as we want. All we need to do is put a comma , between every different thing in the ().

```py

myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

```
- You can combine as many things as you want in any order you want, as long as they're separated by that comma!

```py
number = input("Give me a number: ")
group = input("Give me a collective noun for a group of things: ")
thing = input("Give me the name of a weird or wacky thing: ")
print("No I don't think that", number, "is a", group, "of", thing,". That's just odd.")
```
